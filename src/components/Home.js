        A smuggler without work (you) was drifting throughout that galaxy
        searching for their next big job. When they stopped in for a drink at
        Mos Eisley's Cantina.

        Who do you find there? The one two punch of the smuggling world, none
        other than Han Solo and Chewbacca. You ask them for work and Han is a
        bit hestiant. He needs to see if you are truly a Star Wars fan.
        <br />
        He also would like you round up some extra hands to help on this
        smuggling journey, choose wisley, because it may be pretty challenging.
